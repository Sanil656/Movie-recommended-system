# Movie-recommended-system
This Movie Recommender System is a content-based machine learning project built using Python and Streamlit. It recommends the top 5 similar movies based on user selection using cosine similarity. Movie posters are fetched in real-time using the TMDB API, providing an interactive and user-friendly web application experience.
## 📌 Project Overview

This project recommends movies by calculating similarity between movies using cosine similarity.  
The system is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

Users can:
- Select a movie from a dropdown
- Get top 5 similar movie recommendations
- View movie posters fetched from TMDB API

## 🚀 Features

- Content-based movie recommendation
- Cosine similarity algorithm
- Interactive Streamlit web app
- Real-time movie posters using TMDB API
- Simple and fast UI

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Movie data is processed and stored in pickle files
2. Cosine similarity is calculated between movies
3. User selects a movie
4. System finds the most similar movies
5. Movie posters are fetched using TMDB API
6. Results are displayed on the web app

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas

## Important 
Due to the large size of the dataset, I have uploaded the data separately on LinkedIn. The project code uses this dataset to build a content-based Movie Recommender System and demonstrates data preprocessing, similarity calculation, and real-time movie recommendations.
